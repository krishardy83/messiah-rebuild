      <h2>Welcome to Web Services</h2>

      <p>
        The Web Services Office at Messiah University, housed within the Office of Marketing and
        Communications, functions as the central hub overseeing the University's external website
        and associated web services. The office operates under the leadership of the Director of Web
        and Digital Marketing, with day-to-day management entrusted to the Web Services Manager.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our basic web design and consulting services are generally provided at no cost to campus
        clients. However, should the need arise for services beyond our internal capabilities,
        collaboration with an external vendor may be required, incurring additional expenses.
      </p>
