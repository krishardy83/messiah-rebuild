      At Messiah, we believe athletic experiences are an important part of your academic, personal
      and spiritual growth. Whether you’re a student athlete or an enthusiastic Falcons fan, Messiah
      Athletics serve as a central and exciting piece of our college community and provide a common
      bond for school spirit. In addition to NCAA athletics, there are many club sports and
      recreational leagues on campus. No matter what level you compete at, you practice something of
      lifelong importance—directing your talents and hard work toward a greater purpose.
