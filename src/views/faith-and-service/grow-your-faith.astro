        Chapel is a central expression of our identity as a Christ-centered community with a deep
        commitment to spiritual growth and academic excellence. It is a required cocurricular
        opportunity that exposes you to various forms of worship, speakers and ideas.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 paragraph">
        Chapel is offered on <strong>Tuesday morning, Tuesday evening</strong> and <strong
          >Thursday morning</strong
        > and is designed to strengthen biblical literacy and faith formation within the Messiah University
        community.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 paragraph">
        Some chapels are marked by dynamic student-led worship music, prayer and a brief message
        from a speaker such as student chaplain, campus pastor, academic scholar, notable leader or
        individuals from outside organizations.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 paragraph">
        Other chapels feature a more intimate, contemplative setting of worship and intellectual
        reflection on the Christian faith and life. Another chapel option is a small group
        atmosphere in which students commit to meet for five-six weeks to discuss and explore a
        specific topic or book or learn about and engage in a spiritual discipline. These chapels
        are led by Messiah educators and other invited guests.

      <p class="paragraph">
        <strong
          >Students are expected to attend 14 approved chapel opportunities each semester.</strong
        > You are free to choose the chapels in which you will participate to fulfill that requirement.
        For all chapels, you will record your attendance electronically with your student I.D. card.

      <p class="mb-8 paragraph">
        At Messiah, you'll have the opportunity to grow your faith and become a spiritual leader.
        One area where you can combine the two is through student-led worship. Choose from leading
        or participating in groups ranging from student chaplains and small group Bible studies, to
        music ministry groups, dance ministries and other worship arts. Our student ministry leaders
        strive to help the entire campus community commit to a life of faithful discovery and
        service to Jesus Christ. At Messiah, youâ€™ll find there are numerous ways to learn and grow
        together with your friends and classmates.

              On Thursday evenings, students pack out Hostetter Chapel eagerly anticipating the time
              of corporate worship and reflection known as Powerhouse. Though attendance is purely
              optional, Powerhouse never fails to fill the chapel with students ready to worship God
              together.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph mb-4">
              Powerhouse began as a small student-led Bible study. Today, Powerhouse is still
              primarily student-initiated and student-led, but has grown to include a team of
              worship leaders who have devoted their talents to honoring and responding to God
              through music. It is more than just another weekly event that students add to their
              schedules. It is a diverse community of worshipers who come together weekly to praise
              and worship God in a powerful way through shared music and prayer.
