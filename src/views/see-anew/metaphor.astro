      <p class="paragraph mb-8">
        At Messiah, each student brings a valuable perspective that is celebrated, appreciated and
        allowed to remain distinct. In the grace of our shared love of Christ - and in our worship,
        study and service - we combine our individual contributions into a community that is more
        beautiful together - like a strong and vibrant stained glass window.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph mb-8">
        <i>And the insight that is born in everyone is the light that shines through.</i> Together we
        see anew.
