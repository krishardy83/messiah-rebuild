  <h2>Accounting-specific scholarships</h2>

  <p>
    Because of the accounting program's strong alumni support network, we are thrilled to offer over
    10 different scholarship opportunities to incoming and current accounting major students.
  </p>

  <h2>Soft skill integration</h2>

  <p>
    The Association of International Certified Professional Accounts (AICPA) says, “Accountants are
    taking an increasingly visible role within their organizations, working on cross-departmental
    projects ranging from strategic planning to information technology initiatives. In addition,
    they are presenting data to a number of diverse audiences. As a result, employers look for
    accounting professionals who not only possess financial expertise but also strong communication
    skills.”
  </p>

  <p>
    This major offers a distinctive experiential program that incorporates the teaching of
    communication into the upper-level accounting course sequence. Evaluated for accuracy, clarity
    and succinctness in both written and oral forms of communication, you will learn soft skills
    necessary for working with peers and communicating solutions to executives.
